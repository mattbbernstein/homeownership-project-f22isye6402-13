Homeownership Project code plan:
- Exploratory Analysis
	- Fit splines, residual analysis
	- Differencing: stationarity analysis
	- Are there outliers or issues?
		- How to handle? Cleaning data with linear interpolation, log or box-cox transformation
- Univariate modelling
	- Model A: Cascading model, ARIMA or ARMA-GARCH on Splines residuals (log transformed if needed)
	- Model B: ARIMA or ARMA-GARCH on differenced data
	- Residual analysis for goodness-of-fit
	- Forecasting accuracy
- Multivariate modelling
	- Model A: VAR on cascaded residual model
	- Model B: VAR on differenced data model
	- Residual analysis for goodness-of-fit
	- Granger causality analysis?
	- Forecasting accuracy
- Comparison between multivariate and univariate
	- Is there exogenous factors that aid in forecasting.
